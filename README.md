Invaders
========

This is just my version of Lab #3 ("Invaders") in the book *Head First C#*, by O'Reilly Media.  (Note: It's a really good book and anybody who really wants to learn C# should get it.)

Things I changed from the book's version:

- Every so often (meaning every time your score hits a threshold) you get an extra life.
- You can hold down <kbd>S</kbd> to get a random score increase.

Comments, feedback, and issues are much appreciated.

How to Play
-----------

Go to bin/Debug and run `Invaders.exe`.
